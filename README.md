# CRM-visual-workflow-builder--CLOSE
This prototype should demonstrate end-to-end workflow creation in Close CRM, allowing non-technical sales and customer success teams to automate complex processes effectively, reducing manual busywork and improving productivity without leaving the platform.

Drag-and-Drop Visual Workflow Builder for Close CRM
Pain Point
Close CRM offers powerful automation; however, many users experience friction due to complex, manual workflow setups or a dependence on external tools like Zapier and Make. This slows down sales, customer success, and support teams, especially when managing multi-step, branching processes across different departments.

Solution
This project develops a native, intuitive drag-and-drop visual workflow builder fully integrated into Close CRM. The builder simplifies automation creation and management by enabling users to:

Visually map workflow stages, conditions, branching logic, and automated actions without writing code.

Seamlessly connect sales, customer success, and support tasks within a unified system.

Easily create, edit, test, and deploy automated workflows for communications (calls, emails, SMS), lead assignments, follow-ups, and data updates.

Track workflow performance and identify bottlenecks through real-time reporting.

Collaborate across teams with multi-user workflow building and maintenance capabilities.

Prototype Focus
Build UI components that align with Closeâ€™s minimal, clean, and user-friendly design language for seamless integration into the existing CRM interface.

Create a user-friendly drag-and-drop canvas supporting triggers, conditions, delays, and action elements.

Provide a properties panel to customize each step with options such as message templates, recipient selection, and timing controls.

Integrate native Close automation features (email sequences, call reminders, task creation) as draggable action nodes.

Include real-time preview and error-checking to validate workflow logic before deployment.

Support collaboration with commenting and versioning features to enhance team workflow management.
